# Live stock dashboard with Python
The objective of this project is to create a live data dashboard in Python using Matplotlib. Structured (stock prices) and unstructured data (news articles) will be collected using various web APIs.   
News articles will be interpreted and keywords will be extracted based on highest TF-IDF scores and real-time plots of stock prices will be displayed.
